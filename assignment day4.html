        <p>"Hi there! My name is <b>Awe Oluwadarasimi</b>, and I’m just starting my journey as a software engineer.
        <ul>
            <Li>I’m learning how to code and exploring programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</Li>
            <LI>I love figuring out how things work, solving problems, and creating small projects to practice my
                skills.</LI>
        </ul>
        While I’m new to this field, I’m excited to learn, grow, and build cool things along the way.

    <h4><U>Things That I Love Doing apart from coding:<b>(My Hobbies)</U></b></h4></p>
    
   <p>My hobbies are a mix of things that bring me joy, peace, and creativity.

        One of my favorite things to do is <b>eat</b>—especially cooking new dishes.
        I love experimenting with recipes and discovering new flavors, and it’s always a fun challenge to try something
        different in the kitchen.
        Along with cooking, I really enjoy <b>sleeping.</b>
        A good night’s rest is important to me, and it helps me feel refreshed and ready for whatever comes next.
        Another Thing I love doing is <b>reading, and I do a lot of it.</b>
        Whether it’s getting lost in a novel, diving into a non-fiction book to learn something new,
        or reading articles on various topics, I always find myself with a book in hand.
        <b>Journaling</b> is something I do regularly, too.
        It’s a great way for me to reflect on my thoughts and feelings, keep track of my goals,
        and sometimes just write down what’s on my mind.
        Along with journaling, <b>I also love reading my Bible.</b> It gives me a sense of peace and direction, and I
        enjoy
        reflecting on the wisdom it offers.
        Finally, <b>crocheting is a hobby I’ve picked up, and it’s been so relaxing.</b> Creating things with yarn is a
        creative outlet for me,
        whether it’s making Cute Tops, Gown, or little decorative items. Each of these hobbies helps me unwind, express
        myself,
        and stay connected to things that matter to me—whether it’s food, faith, or creativity.
